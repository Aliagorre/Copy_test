# UnHax
A "slightly compact" but overpowered cheat mod for UnCiv. Really, that's it.<br>
No "Sandbox" difficulty or overpowered nations included. How you're gonna get the cheat is all up to you to figure it out.
(No, it's not using a different mod linked below, btw, but it still works anyways. The solution is extremely simple, really.)<br>

Fair warning: Use at your own risk as this mod *can* ruin your experience. It is, after all, a cheat mod.


## What the mod contains:
### Buildings:
**UnHax Mode - Base**: an "*almost* one-size-fits-all" building that includes many 
things such as gold, food, culture, science, production, happiness, unit XP, and 
great person points (except Great General and Great Prophet), all in large quantities, 
as well as some unit promotions that are otherwise exclusive or difficult to obtain, 
and the ability to reveal the entire map early on. Limited to the capital city only, 
cannot be sold, and is destroyed when the capital falls.<br>

**UnHax Mode - Religion**: a building made specifically for religion-enabled games, generating 
Faith and Great Prophet points at large quantities, and allows for immediate founding of Pantheons. 
It has similar limitations as the **Base** building, and it is only buildable when the **Base** 
building is already built in the capital city and when religion is enabled.<br>

## Changelog:
### v1.1
*I might have gone overboard making this update, but it's a cheat mod anyways, so...*
- Renamed **UnHax Mode** to **UnHax Mode - Base**
- Added **UnHax Mode - Religion**, which is available only when religion is enabled
- Added free **Great General I** promotion for all new military units on **Base**
- Removed Faith generation and immediate Pantheon founding on **Base**; **Religion** handles those now

- Increases in all seven stats now apply *in all cities*, with the capital gaining double the increase (except Gold)
- Reduced **Base** maintenance cost from 69420 to 4200 <s>(nice)</s>
- Increased great person points generation from 69 <s>(also nice)</s> to 77 <s>(not nice)</s>
- Increased Production provided by **Base** from 420 to 690 <s>(triply nice)</s>
