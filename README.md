# UnHax
An overpowered, building-based cheat mod for UnCiv. Really, that's it.<br>
No "Sandbox" difficulty or overpowered nations included. How you're gonna get the cheat is all up to you to figure it out.
(No, it's not using a different mod linked below, by the way, but it still works anyways. Hint: "Tradition" social policy.)<br>

Fair warning: Use at your own risk as this mod *can* ruin your experience.<br>
If it did, then... what did you expect? It's a cheat mod, after all lol

## What the mod contains
### Buildings
**UnHax Mode - Base**: an "*almost* one-size-fits-all" building that provides many things such as gold, food, culture, 
science, production, happiness, unit XP, and great person points (except Great General and Great Prophet), all in large 
quantities, as well as some unit promotions that are otherwise exclusive or difficult to obtain, and extra specialist slots. 
Limited to the capital city only, cannot be sold, and is destroyed when the capital falls. (Added in v1.0; renamed in v1.1)<br>

**UnHax Mode - Religion**: a building made specifically for religion-enabled games, generating Faith at large quantities, 
and allows for immediate founding and enhancing of religions. It has similar limitations as the **Base** building, 
with an extra caveat of being unbuildable, but can be bought in the capital city once **Base** has been built. **Religion** is 
split into two buildings, **Monotheistic Religion** and **Polytheistic Religion**, both of which give different belief slots 
for founding/enhancing a religion but otherwise functions identically the same. 
(Added in v1.1; method of acquisition changed in v1.5; split in v1.10)<br>

**UnHax Mode - Military**: a military-oriented building that provides free unit promotions not 
provided (or previously provided) by **Base**, increased city strength and city health, and others. It has similar 
limitations as the **Religion** building, but unlike the first two buildings, it can be built on all cities by 
buying it with Gold once the **Base** building has been built in the capital. (Added in v1.2; renamed in v1.5)<br>

**UnHax Mode - Enhancement**: a building with assorted bonuses to build on the already plentiful additions provided by 
**Base**, **Military**, and **Religion**. It shares multiple limitations and mode of acquisition with the **Religion** building, 
sans the requirement of the "Enable Religion" option. (Added in v1.3)<br>
