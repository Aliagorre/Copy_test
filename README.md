A "slightly compact" but overpowered cheat mod for UnCiv. Really, that's it.
No "Sandbox" difficulty included. How you're gonna get the cheat is all up to you to figure it out.
(No, it's not using a different mod linked below, btw, but it works anyways.)

Warning: Use at your own risk as this mod *can* ruin your experience.
