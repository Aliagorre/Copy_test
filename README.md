# UnHax
An overpowered, building-based cheat mod for UnCiv. Really, that's it.<br>
No "Sandbox" difficulty or overpowered nations included, but either from another mod can work just fine. 
Human players can directly access the cheat buildings for free, while anyone, including 
the AI Civs, can also utilize the original method of obtaining it. (Please read the **Base** 
building's Civilopedia entry on how to do the original method.)<br>

Fair warning: Use at your own risk as this mod *can* ruin your experience.<br>
If it did, then... what did you expect? It's a cheat mod, after all lol

### Recommendation/s
UnHax is best used with [Strategic Resource Visibility](https://github.com/not-navyblue/Strategic-Resource-Visibility) for the maximum UnCiv hax.

### Mod Compatibility
- Starting with v1.13, the direct method of the **Base** building will blocked if there is any extension mod that modifies the Palace 
or adds a unique counterpart of it (which, hopefully, there is none). Compatible base ruleset mods are exempted, however.

## What the mod contains
### Changes from Vanilla/G&K rulesets
- Palace allows players to directly buy the **Base** building for free
- Settlers and Great People can move immediately once bought
- Mountain tiles do not inflict 50 tile damage to units
- **Home Sweet Home** is buffed (UnHax: +40% vs. normal: +30%)
- Near-unlimited XP from barbarians

### Buildings
**UnHax Mode - Original Method**: a building made for any players, including the AIs, to obtain the **Base** building 
via the original method. Does not do anything else other than this simple purpose.
- Added in v1.13<br>

**UnHax Mode - Base**: an "*almost* one-size-fits-all" building that provides many things such as gold, food, culture, 
science, production, happiness, unit XP, and great person points (except Great General and Great Prophet), all in large 
quantities, as well as some unit promotions that are otherwise exclusive or difficult to obtain, and extra specialist slots. 
Limited to the capital city only, cannot be sold, and is destroyed when the capital falls. From v1.13 onwards, players have 
the option to choose the direct method or the original method to acquire this building.
- Added in v1.0
- Renamed in v1.1
- Method of acquisition updated in v1.13<br>

**UnHax Mode - Religion**: a building made specifically for religion-enabled games, generating Faith at large quantities, 
and allows for immediate founding and enhancing of religions. It has similar limitations as the **Base** building, 
with an extra caveat of being unbuildable, but can be bought in the capital city once **Base** has been built. **Religion** is 
split into two buildings, **Monotheistic Religion** and **Polytheistic Religion**, both of which give different belief slots 
for founding/enhancing a religion but otherwise functions identically the same. 
- Added in v1.1
- Method of acquisition changed in v1.5
- Split in v1.10<br>

**UnHax Mode - Military**: a military-oriented building that provides free unit promotions not 
provided (or previously provided) by **Base**, increased city strength and city health, and others. It has similar 
limitations as the **Religion** building, but unlike the first two buildings, it can be built on all cities by 
buying it with Gold once the **Base** building has been built in the capital. 
- Added in v1.2
- Renamed in v1.5<br>

**UnHax Mode - Enhancement**: a building with assorted bonuses to build on the already plentiful additions provided by 
**Base**, **Military**, and **Religion**. It shares multiple limitations and mode of acquisition with the **Religion** building, 
sans the requirement of the "Enable Religion" option. 
- Added in v1.3<br>

**Hackerman Palace** / **Ecalap**: two Palace replacement buildings that automatically unlock the **Base** building and build the 
**Military** building on all cities. Unique to Hack Land and Upside Down, respectively. **Hackerman Palace is intended to not have an icon.**
- Added in v1.14<br>
