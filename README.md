A "slightly compact" but overpowered cheat mod for UnCiv. Really, that's it.<br>
No "Sandbox" difficulty included. How you're gonna get the cheat is all up to you to figure it out.
(No, it's not using a different mod linked below, btw, but it works anyways.)<br>

Fair warning: Use at your own risk as this mod *can* ruin your experience.
