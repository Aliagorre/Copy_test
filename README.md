# UnHax
An overpowered, building-based cheat mod for UnCiv. Really, that's it.<br>
No "Sandbox" difficulty or overpowered nations included. How you're gonna get the cheat is all up to you to figure it out.
(No, it's not using a different mod linked below, by the way, but it still works anyways. Hint: "Tradition" social policy.)<br>

Fair warning: Use at your own risk as this mod *can* ruin your experience.<br>
If it did, then... what did you expect? It's a cheat mod, after all lol

### Quick Notice:
As of v1.5, the building has been renamed from "**UnHax Mode - Military+**" to "**UnHax Mode - Military**". To maintain 
compatibility for versions from v1.2 to v1.4, both buildings will have to remain for now, but **Military+** is unobtainable 
by any means, is no longer updated, and can be sold. Players must sell their **Military+** buildings and replace them with 
**Military** buildings before this makeshift compatibility patch gets removed in a future update.

## What the mod contains:
### Buildings:
**UnHax Mode - Base**: an "*almost* one-size-fits-all" building that includes many things such as gold, food, culture, 
science, production, happiness, unit XP, and great person points (except Great General and Great Prophet), all in large 
quantities, as well as some unit promotions that are otherwise exclusive or difficult to obtain, and extra specialist slots. 
Limited to the capital city only, cannot be sold, and is destroyed when the capital falls. (Added in v1.0; renamed in v1.1)<br>

**UnHax Mode - Religion**: a building made specifically for religion-enabled games, generating 
Faith <s>and Great Prophet points</s> at large quantities, and allows for immediate founding of Pantheons. 
It has similar limitations as the **Base** building, with an extra caveat of being unbuildable, but can be 
bought in the capital city once **Base** has been built. (Added in v1.1; method of acquisition changed in v1.5)<br>

**UnHax Mode - Military**: a military-oriented building that provides free unit promotions not 
provided (or previously provided) by **Base**, increased city strength and city health, and others. It has similar 
limitations as the **Religion** building, but unlike the first two buildings, it can be built on all cities by 
buying it with Gold once the **Base** building has been built in the capital. (Added in v1.2; renamed in v1.5)<br>

**UnHax Mode - Enhancement**: a building with assorted bonuses to build on the already plentiful additions provided by 
**Base** and **Military+**. It shares multiple limitations and mode of acquisition with the **Religion** building, 
sans the requirement of the "Enable Religion" option. (Added in v1.3)<br>

### Unit Promotions:
**Mastery of War** and **Air Superiority**: +110% Strength when attacking, +130% Strength when defending (**Mastery of War**) 
Damage taken from interception reduced by 100% (**Air Superiority**), 1 additional attack per turn, 
Ignores Zone of Control (**Mastery of War**) (Added in v1.2)<br>

**Brilliant Detonation**: +365% Strength when attacking, Damage taken from interception reduced by 90% (for Atomic Bombers), 
+5 Range, Great General is earned 80% faster (Added in v1.2)<br>

**Enhanced Vision**, **Better Wayfinding**, and **Improved Radar**: Increased visibility range (**Enhanced Vision**: +2 / 
**Better Wayfinding**: +4) and movement/range (**Enhanced Vision**: +2 / **Better Wayfinding**: +1 / **Improved Radar**: +4) (Added in v1.2)<br>

**Civilian Assistance**: All adjacent units heal 60 extra HP when healing, Bonus for units in 2-tile radius 15% (Added in v1.3)<br>

**Panacea's Gift**: Heals 40 damage if it kills a Unit, May heal outside of friendly territory, Unit will heal every turn even if it 
performs an action, All healing effects doubled (Added in v1.5)<br>
