# UnHax
A "slightly compact" but overpowered cheat mod for UnCiv. Really, that's it.<br>
No "Sandbox" difficulty or overpowered nations included. How you're gonna get the cheat is all up to you to figure it out.
(No, it's not using a different mod linked below, btw, but it still works anyways. The solution is extremely simple, really.)<br>

Fair warning: Use at your own risk as this mod *can* ruin your experience. It is, after all, a cheat mod.


## What the mod contains:
**UnHax Mode** - a one-size-fits-all building that includes many things such as gold, food, 
culture, science, production, happiness, unit XP, and faith (in Religion-enabled games), all in 
large quantities, as well as some unit promotions that are otherwise exclusive or difficult to 
obtain. Limited to the capital only, cannot be sold, and is destroyed when the capital falls 
(which means you lose the cheat, so better secure the capital).<br>
