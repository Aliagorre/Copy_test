# UnHax
A "slightly compact" but overpowered cheat mod for UnCiv. Really, that's it.<br>
No "Sandbox" difficulty or overpowered nations included. How you're gonna get the cheat is all up to you to figure it out.
(No, it's not using a different mod linked below, by the way, but it still works anyways. Hint: Social policy.)<br>

Fair warning: Use at your own risk as this mod *can* ruin your experience.<br>
If it did, then... what did you expect? It's a cheat mod, after all lol


## What the mod contains:
### Buildings:
**UnHax Mode - Base**: an "*almost* one-size-fits-all" building that includes many 
things such as gold, food, culture, science, production, happiness, unit XP, and 
great person points (except Great General and Great Prophet), all in large quantities, 
as well as some unit promotions that are otherwise exclusive or difficult to obtain. 
Limited to the capital city only, cannot be sold, and is destroyed when the capital falls. (Added in v1.0)<br>

**UnHax Mode - Religion**: a building made specifically for religion-enabled games, generating 
Faith <s>and Great Prophet points</s> at large quantities, and allows for immediate founding of Pantheons. 
It has similar limitations as the **Base** building, and it is buildable in the capital only when the **Base** 
building is already built in the capital city and when religion is enabled. (Added in v1.1)<br>

**UnHax Mode - Military+**: a military-oriented building that provides free unit promotions not 
provided (or previously provided) by **Base**, increased city strength and city health, and others. Like **Religion**, 
it has similar limitations as the **Base** building, with an extra caveat of being unbuildable, but unlike the 
first two buildings, it can be built on all cities by buying it with Gold once the **Base** building has 
been built in the capital. (Added in v1.2)<br>

**UnHax Mode - Enhancement**: a building with assorted bonuses to build on the already plentiful additions provided by 
**Base** and **Military+**. It shares multiple limitations with the **Military+** building, but it can be bought in 
the capital only when **Base** is built in the capital city. (Added in v1.3)<br>

## Changelog:
